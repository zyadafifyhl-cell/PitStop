-- Fix product-images storage RLS: owner_email path checks were blocking valid merchant uploads.

-- 1. Ensure 'product-images' bucket exists and is marked public
insert into storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
values (
  'product-images',
  'product-images',
  true,
  10485760,
  array['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp', 'image/gif', 'image/heic', 'image/heif']
)
on conflict (id) do update
set public = true,
    file_size_limit = 10485760,
    allowed_mime_types = array['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp', 'image/gif', 'image/heic', 'image/heif'];

-- 2. Drop existing conflicting/restrictive policies on storage.objects for this bucket
drop policy if exists "Public Read Product Images" on storage.objects;
drop policy if exists "Allow All Uploads Product Images" on storage.objects;
drop policy if exists "Allow All Updates Product Images" on storage.objects;
drop policy if exists "Allow All Deletes Product Images" on storage.objects;
drop policy if exists "Authenticated Users Can Upload Product Images" on storage.objects;
drop policy if exists "Store Owners Can Upload Product Images" on storage.objects;
drop policy if exists "Give users access to own folder product-images" on storage.objects;
drop policy if exists "Public product images are readable" on storage.objects;
drop policy if exists "Store owners upload product images" on storage.objects;
drop policy if exists "Store owners update product images" on storage.objects;
drop policy if exists "Store owners delete product images" on storage.objects;
drop policy if exists "Allow Uploads to Product Images" on storage.objects;
drop policy if exists "Allow Updates to Product Images" on storage.objects;
drop policy if exists "Allow Deletes to Product Images" on storage.objects;

-- 3. Create permissive policies for 'product-images' bucket
create policy "Public Read Product Images"
on storage.objects for select
using (bucket_id = 'product-images');

create policy "Allow Uploads to Product Images"
on storage.objects for insert
to authenticated
with check (bucket_id = 'product-images');

create policy "Allow Updates to Product Images"
on storage.objects for update
to authenticated
using (bucket_id = 'product-images');

create policy "Allow Deletes to Product Images"
on storage.objects for delete
to authenticated
using (bucket_id = 'product-images');
